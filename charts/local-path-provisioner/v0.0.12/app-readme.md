Local Path Provisioner provides a way for the Kubernetes users to utilize the local storage in each node. Based on the user configuration, the Local Path Provisioner will create `hostPath` based persistent volume on the node automatically. It utilizes the features introduced by Kubernetes [Local Persistent Volume feature](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/), but make it a simpler solution than the built-in `local` volume feature in Kubernetes.
